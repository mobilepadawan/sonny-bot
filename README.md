# sonny-bot
A sample code of an Internet Bot.
It is building in Vanilla JavaScript. I just code a simple interface where the bot response with echo to a user's message.

## Project Goal

I wanna build a simple bot who response to a user interaction, taking the response from a JSON file. Simple but effective.

### Resources
I'll build a JSON file and will use all the JSON methods to filter the most apropriate answer to a user. I am not the intention to install an AI backend to interaction. I'll just build it from scratch and with no artificial intelligence help.
